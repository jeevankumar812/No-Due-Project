## **📌 Overview**  
The **No Due System** is a web-based application that digitalizes the traditional no-due clearance process for students. Students can upload their assignments for various subjects, and faculty can review and approve them online. Once all subjects are approved, the system automatically generates a **No Due Certificate** in PDF format.  

This project ensures:  
✅ Paperless workflow  
✅ Real-time status tracking
